**OpenEQOA Server Emulator**

OpenEQOA is a server emulator for _EverQuest: Online Adventures_.
Currently this is a rough draft of the emulator and not fully operational.
Please feel free to clone the repo and give a hand at getting this fully working.

To continue progress, please point your attention to:
 com.openeqoa.server.network.udp.UDPConnection.
 
 Here you will find at the bottom the current progress on getting the client to see a list of servers.

**Installation**
To open the project, import it as a Gradle project in your favorite IDE. I recommend Intellij Community Edition.
Next make sure you have the Lombok plugin installed. https://projectlombok.org/
